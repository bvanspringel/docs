```json

  "plcnext": {
    "ipAddress": "172.200.1.120",
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "xxxxxxxx"
  },
  "mqtt": {
    "broker": {
      "ipAddress": "172.200.1.120"
    }
  },
  "telegram": {
    "chatId": "-xxxxxxxxxx",
    "botToken": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  },
  "nats": {
    "cloudUsername": "plc",
    "cloudPassword": "xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "ipAddress": "159.223.110.128",

  }
}

<Warning>
Please note that the configuration file comes pre-filled with all the necessary parameters. The only exception is if the controller's IP address changes during commissioning. In that case, you will need to update the **ipAddress** entries in both the **plcnext** and **mqtt** sections. All other parameters can remain unchanged.
