    "username": "admin",
    "password": "xxxxxxxx"

  "telegram": {
    "chatId": "-xxxxxxxxxx",
    "botToken": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  },
  "nats": {
    "local": {
      "username": "client",
      "password": "xxxxxxxx"
    },
    "cloud": {
      "username": "plc",
      "password": "xxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "ipAddress": "192.168.1.5",

  }
}
```

<Warning>
Please note that the configuration file comes pre-filled with all the necessary parameters. The only exception is if the controller's IP address changes during commissioning. 
In that case, you will need to update the ipAddress entries in both the plcnext and mqtt sections. All other parameters can remain unchanged.
</Warning>
