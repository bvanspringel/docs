title: Configuration
---

The configuration file is essential for the proper functioning of the controller, as it includes important settings related to its communication interfaces, such as MQTT, Telegram, and NATS. Specifically, the configuration file must include four required entries, which need to be configured for each controller. These entries are:

- **plcnext**
- **mqtt**
- **telegram**
- **nats**

Below, we will provide detailed information on each entry, including the required parameters and any optional ones. The configuration file can be found in the `/etc` folder of the `ppl-base` repository and is listed as `config.json`.

## plcnext

### Required Parameters

<ParamField path="ipAddress" type="string" required>
This is the IP address of the controller. It should always be configured to the controller’s current IP address, as it is used to create sockets.

**Example:** `192.168.1.10`
</ParamField>

### Optional Parameters

Though these parameters are not required for the controller to operate, it is good practice to include them in the configuration file to avoid losing track of login credentials.

<ParamField path="username" type="string">
The username for logging into the WBM of the controller or a shell session. This should be set to `admin`.

**Example:** `admin`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="password" type="string">
The password for logging into the WBM of the controller or a shell session.

**Example:** `password`
</ParamField>

## mqtt

### Required Parameters

<ParamField path="broker" type="object" required>
This entry contains all relevant information for the broker. At this time, only the **ipAddress** is required. The IP address should be the controller’s current IP address. For clarity, refer to the final configuration file example below.

**Example:**
```json icon="code"
{
  "broker": {
    "ipAddress": "192.168.1.10"
  }
}
```
</ParamField>

## telegram

Telegram is preconfigured in the config file to enable notifications and alerts. These include livebit messages every 24 hours and alerts for critical device failures in the system. If the customer does not wish to receive updates via Telegram, they simply need to remove this entry from the config file.

### Required Parameters

<ParamField path="chatID" type="string" required>
Represents the unique chat ID of the Telegram channel. Each Telegram channel has its own unique ID.

**Example:** `123456789`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="botToken" type="string" required>
A token consisting of letters and numbers, required for authorizing the bot and sending requests to the Bot API. The Bot API is already added to the Telegram channel.

**Example:** `123456789:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`
</ParamField>

## nats

### Required Parameters

The required parameters are used to set up a local NATS server on the controller. This NATS server is used to integrate with custom applications developed by the customer.

<ParamField path="local" type="object" required>
The required parameters are used to set up a local NATS server on the controller. This NATS server is used to integrate with custom applications developed by the customer.

**Example:**
```json icon="code"
{
  "local": {
    "username": "client",
    "password": "xxxxxxxx"
  }
}
```
</ParamField>

### Optional Parameters

The optional parameters are used for setting up a NATS connection to the cloud, which hosts a database for storing measurements. By providing these parameters, the controller can periodically push data to the cloud.

<ParamField path="cloud" type="object">
The optional parameters are used for setting up a NATS connection to the cloud, which hosts a database for storing measurements. By providing these parameters, the controller can periodically push data to the cloud.

**Example:**
```json icon="code"
{
  "cloud": {
    "username": "client",
    "password": "xxxxxxxx",
    "ipAddress": "192.168.1.5",
    "bucket": "my-bucket"
  }
}
```
</ParamField>
