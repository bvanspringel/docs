title: Analog I/O
---

### Naming Conventions

While not mandatory, it is recommended to adopt the following naming conventions for clarity and usability:

- **Write Operations:** Prefix register names with "control." to indicate that the register is used to set the analog output.
- **Read Operations:** Prefix register names with "measure." to signify that the register is used to read the analog input signal.

See the example address map below for register naming conventions.

### Required Parameters

- **name:** A unique name for the register. (Type: String, e.g., "measure.voltage")
- **address:** Corresponds to the number on the analog input or output module. (Type: Int)
    
    <Note>
    Please note that the address should start from 0, not from 1.
    </Note>
    
- **type:** Indicates whether the register is an input or an output. (Type: String, options: "input", "output")

### Optional Parameters

- **scaling:** The scaling factor to apply to the analog register's return value or the value being written. (Type: Float or Int, e.g., 0.1 or 10)
- **offset:** The offset to apply to the analog register's return value or the value being written. (Type: Float or Int, e.g., 100)

### Example

```json address_map.json icon="file-json"
[
	{        
    "name": "measure.voltage",
    "address": 0,
    "type": "input",
    "scaling": 50,
    "offset": 100
	},
	{        
    "name": "control.lights",
    "address": 0,
    "type": "output"
  }
]
