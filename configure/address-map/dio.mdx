title: Digital I/O
---

### Naming Conventions

While not mandatory, it is recommended to adopt the following naming conventions for clarity and usability:

- **Write Operations:** Prefix register names with "control." to indicate that the register is used to set the digital output.
- **Read Operations:** Prefix register names with "measure." to signify that the register is used to read the digital input signal.

See the example address map below for register naming conventions.

### Required Parameters

- **name:** A unique name for the register. (Type: String, e.g., "measure.start")
- **address:** Corresponds to the number on the digital input or output module. (Type: Int)
    
    <aside>
    ‚ùó Please note that the address should start from 0, not from 1. However, the physical address on the I/O module begins at 1.
    
    </aside>
    
- **type:** Indicates whether the register is an input or an output. (Type: String, options: "input", "output")

### Optional Parameters

- **invert:** Indicates whether to invert the input or output of the digital I/O, meaning that "on" becomes "off" and vice versa. This relates to the digital input or output being a normally open or normally closed contact. (Type: Bool)

### Example

```json
[
	{        
    "name": "control.reset",
    "address": 2,
    "type": "output"
  },
  {        
    "name": "measure.start",
    "address": 6,
    "type": "input"
  },
  {        
    "name": "measure.stop",
    "address": 7,
    "type": "input",
    "invert": true
  }
]
```
