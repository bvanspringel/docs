The purpose of this section is to guide you in creating comprehensive and accurate address maps, which are essential for effective communication between a controller and its connected devices. Address maps act as blueprints, detailing how to access and manipulate device registers for reading data or issuing commands.

This section will specifically cover the creation of address maps for various communication protocols, including Modbus TCP/IP, MQTT, digital I/O’s and analog I/O’s. Each subsection will provide detailed instructions, conventions to follow, and examples to illustrate the process. By adopting consistent naming conventions and including all required and optional parameters, you will be able to create address maps that ensure seamless integration and communication within your system.

The address maps are located in the `/etc` folder of the `ppl-base` repository. They follow a typical naming convention: `<uniqueName>_address_map.json`. Each address map file should always have a `.json` extension.
