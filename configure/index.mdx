In this section, the process of configuring the devices file and the config file on the PPL controller will be explained. These files are essential for the controller's operation and communication with devices in the microgrid. Additionally, the creation of custom address and control maps for various devices, including Modbus devices and digital and analog I/Oâ€™s, will be covered.

Direct Energy Partners has created a personalized repository called `ppl-base` for each customer, containing all the necessary files and folders required to operate the microgrid controller. Customers can start modifying these files to suit their specific microgrid applications. Below, you will find detailed instructions on how to clone this repository using **Visual Studio Code** (our preferred code editor).
