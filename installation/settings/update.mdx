## Upgrade Firmware

There are two possible ways to upgrade the firmware of the Power Platform controller. One way is to use the **Web-Based Management (WBM)** interface and the other way is to use 
a **Shell session**. Regardless of the two options to update the firmware version of the controller, you first need to download the firmware from the Phoenix Contact website. For that:

- Under Firmware, open the Version 2024.0 LTS plane and click on `AXC_F_2152_FW_2024_0_LTS.zip` to start the download.
- Extract the ZIP file on your local computer.


### Through WBM (recommended)
<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Administration Tab">
    Navigate to the **Administration** tab in the left navigation plane and select **Firmware Update**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload raucb File">
    Upload the `.raucb` file from the extracted ZIP folder.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Update">
    Click on **Start Update** to start the update process. This process can take up to 2-3 minutes. The controller will automatically reboot after the update is complete.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Through Shell Session

<Steps>
  <Step title="Copy Firmware File">
    Copy the `axcf2152-2024.0.0_LTS-24.0.0.102.raucb` file from the extracted ZIP archive to the controller using SCP (Secure Copy Protocol):
    ```bash
    scp axcf2152-2024.0.5_LTS-24.0.5.140.raucb admin@192.168.1.10:~
    ```
    Alternatively, use an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) software such as FileZilla to copy or move the `.raucb` file to the controller.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Shell Session">
    Open a shell session:
    ```bash
    ssh admin@192.168.1.10
    ```
    Enter the default password (printed on the housing of the controller).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stop Controller Runtime">
    ```bash
    sudo /etc/init.d/plcnext stop
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Firmware">
    ```bash
    rauc install axcf2152-2024.0.0_LTS-24.0.0.102.raucb
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reboot Controller">
    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

Verify in the WBM that the firmware version has been updated to version 2024.0 LTS. Please refer to previous section for more information on how to check the current firmware version.
