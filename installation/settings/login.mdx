To integrate the PPL controller into your local network, you need to change its default **IP address** to a static IP address on your network, 
as well as modify the controller’s **subnet mask** and default **gateway**. This section provides detailed instructions on how to configure the 
network settings of the controller using the Web-Based Management (WBM) interface.

1. **Connect Laptop to PPL Controller:**
Use an Ethernet cable to connect your laptop directly to the PPL controller. The connection method varies depending on your PPL version:
	- **Basic and Premium Versions:** Connect your laptop directly to the PPL controller using any of the two Ethernet ports located at the bottom of the controller.

	- **Pro Version (PPL Panel):** Connect your laptop to the Ethernet connection port at the bottom of the panel. This port is directly connected to the network switch inside the PPL panel.

2. **Set Laptop to the Controller’s IP Range:**
	- The default IP address of the PPL controller is `192.168.1.10`.
	- Temporarily change your laptop's IP settings to be in the same range as the controller’s IP address. To do this, open the network settings on your laptop and either change or add a new static IP address, subnet mask, and gateway. For example:
		- **IP address:** `192.168.1.5`
		- **Subnet mask:** `255.255.255.0`
		- **Default gateway:** `192.168.1.1`
		
		Below is explained how to change or add the network settings for Windows and Mac.
			
	- **For Windows:**
			- Open **Network Connections**.
			- Right-click on the desired network connection and select **Properties**.
