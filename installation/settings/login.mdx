To integrate the Power Platform controller into your local network, you need to change its default **IP address** to a static IP address on your network, 
as well as modify the controller’s **subnet mask** and default **gateway**. This section provides detailed instructions on how to configure the 
network settings of the controller using the Web-Based Management (WBM) interface.

### Connect Laptop

Use an Ethernet cable to connect your laptop directly to the Power Platform controller. The connection method varies depending on your Power Platform version:

- **Power Platform Controller:** Connect your laptop directly to the Power Platform controller using any of the two Ethernet ports located at the bottom of the controller.

  />
			
- **Power Platform Panel:** Connect your laptop to the Ethernet connection port at the bottom of the panel. This port is directly connected to the network switch inside the Power Platform panel.

### Setup Laptop

Set your laptop to the same IP range as the Power Platform controller. This is required to access the Power Platform controller's Web-Based Management (WBM) interface.

<Note>
  The default IP address of the Power Platform controller is `192.168.1.10`.
</Note>

Temporarily change your laptop's IP settings to be in the same range as the controller’s IP address. To do this, open the network settings on your 
laptop and either change or add a new static IP address, subnet mask, and gateway. For example:
  - **IP address:** `192.168.1.5`
  - **Subnet mask:** `255.255.255.0`
  - **Default gateway:** `192.168.1.1`
  
  Below is explained how to change or add the network settings for Windows and Mac.
