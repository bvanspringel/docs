title: Credentials

It is highly recommended to change the default password for the admin user provided by DEP. Doing so ensures that the controller is more secure with your own selected password. To change the admin user password, follow these steps:

1. **Login to the WBM:**
    - Open a web browser and enter the following URL in the address bar:
    `<ip-address>/wbm` 
    (The IP address is either the default **192.168.1.10** or the newly configured IP address from the previous step.)
    - If prompted with a security warning stating ‘**Your connection is not private’**, click on **Advanced** and then click on **Proceed to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (unsafe)**.

    - Log in using the current credentials provided to you by DEP:
        - Username: `admin`
        - Password: `[provided by DEP]`
2. **Change Admin Password:**
    - Navigate to the **Security** tab in the left navigation plane and select **User Authentication**.
    - For the admin user, click on **Set Password**.

    - Press the **Save** button to save the new password.
