title: What is NATS?
---

First of all, a brief explanation on what NATS is. NATS (Neural Autonomic Transport System) is an open-source messaging system 
ideal for cloud-native applications, IoT messaging, and microservices architectures. It offers:

- **High Performance**: Handles millions of messages per second.
- **Low Latency**: Delivers sub-millisecond latency.
- **Scalability**: Scales effortlessly to millions of connections.
- **Simple API**: Features a straightforward, easy-to-use API.
- **Lightweight**: Utilizes minimal system resources.

### NATS in Power Platform Application

Direct Energy Partners employs NATS for two-way communication between its controller and external applications. 
This setup allows applications like PMS to monitor and control power and energy resources efficiently.

### Communication Patterns

1. **Publish/Subscribe**: External applications subscribe to topics for updates like real-time energy consumption data or alerts.
2. **Request/Reply**: Applications send requests to the controller for actions (e.g., adjusting power settings) and receive immediate responses.
