Direct Energy Partners allows customers to develop their own applications for microgrids. By creating an Energy Management System (**EMS**) or Power Management System (**PMS**), 
customers can customize solutions to fit their specific energy needs. This guide details the process of developing custom applications using the **NATS** protocol to interact with the **Power Platform** (PPL) controller.

To assist customers in starting their application development, we have created a starter repository called `ppl-app`. This repository includes all the necessary files and examples to help you get started. 
Below, you will find detailed instructions on how to clone this repository using **Visual Studio Code** (our preferred code editor), as well as how to run the application and write custom code using the built-in functions.
