title: Clone Repository
---

A personal `ppl-app` GitHub repository is created for every customer. Instructions for creating a GitHub account (if you donâ€™t have one) 
as well as getting access to the repository, will be provided upon request.

<Note>
It is highly recommended to use Visual Studio Code as your code editor. Visual Studio Code is ideal for cloning repositories, 
making changes to existing files, and adding or removing files. It is also useful for running your applications on a local machine, 
allowing you to troubleshoot or test newly developed applications.
