Direct Energy Partners has created a repository that allows customers to develop their own applications. 
Each customer will be assigned a personal GitHub repository to start writing their applications.

 The `ppl-app` repository includes:

- A bash script named `install.sh` for installing dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
- The `pplapp` module.
- A boilerplate template script to help you start writing your own application.
- A `.env` file that stores the username and password for the NATS client connection.
- Example application scripts.

Below, you will find detailed instructions on how to clone your personal repository in Visual Studio Code, 
install the Python libraries and how to run your applications. Additionally, the instructions include guidance 
on writing your own applications using the `pplapp` module and its built-in functions.
