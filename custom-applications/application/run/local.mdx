title: On Local Machine
---

The custom application can be run on various platforms, including your local machine (laptop or desktop), external devices 
such as a Raspberry Pi, or a virtual machine. It can also be executed directly on the PPL controller. This guide provides 
instructions on running the application on your local machine using Visual Studio Code. Additional platform-specific instructions 
will be added in the future.

<Note>
  It is recommended to run your custom application on a local machine first. This approach allows you to test and 
  troubleshoot the newly developed application. Once testing is complete, the application can then be transferred to the 
  Power Platform controller for execution.
</Note>

Follow the steps below to run the custom application on your local machine using the Terminal in Visual Studio Code. 
The instructions assume that Visual Studio Code is already open and the `ppl-app` repository is loaded.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Update IP Address in Application">
    - Modify the IP address in the main function. By default, the controller's IP address is configured.
    
    <Note>
      The IP address for the NATS connection should match the IP address of the Power Platform controller.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update NATS Client Credentials">
    - Open the `.env` file from the left navigation pane.
    - In the `.env` file, update the username and password for the NATS client connection. Default credentials are currently assigned.
  
    <Note>
      The username and password for the NATS connection should match the **username** and **password** specified in the `config.json` file under the **nats local** section.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Open Terminal in VS Code">
    - Click on **Terminal** in the top menu bar and select **New Terminal**.
    - A terminal window will open at the bottom of your screen.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run Application">
    - Execute the Python script in the terminal by running the following command:
    
    ```bash
    python boilerplate.py
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
