Power Platform controller. This capability supports the development of custom applications such as:

- **Energy Management Systems (EMS)**: Optimize energy distribution based on real-time data.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Provide detailed analytics and reporting on power and energy usage.
- **Automation Systems**: Automate responses to specific power or energy usage events, like activating backup generators during peak times.
